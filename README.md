### Nginx config example for running this app behind an nginx server
```
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_read_timeout 300;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-PORT $remote_port;
}
```

### Tips
* Try to use Nginx as a front web server (see config example above) and enable SSL, this will prevent your ssh credentials from being uncovered. Also afterwards the communication between your browser and the web server will be encrypted as they use secured websockets.
* Try to use reject policy as the missing host key policy along with your verified known_hosts, this will prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The idea is that it checks the system host keys file("~/.ssh/known_hosts") and the application host keys file("./known_hosts") in order, if the ssh server's hostname is not found or the key is not matched, the connection will be aborted.
